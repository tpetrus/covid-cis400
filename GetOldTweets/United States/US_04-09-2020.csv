You really do need someone to educate you. NPR: Data from China show that each coronavirus case seems to infect about 2 to 2.5 additional people. That's higher than the flu. The average patient spreads the flu virus to about 1.3 others. C-19 spreads far easier than the Flu.
Coronavirus is probably a Chinese man made virus. That is the reason our evil Liberal media is protecting the Chinese and even spreading their Chinese propaganda and the corrupt world health organization.
