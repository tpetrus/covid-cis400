Woah.... White House Coronavirus Task Force Briefing starts off with speaking about illegal drugs?
@CNN What does drugs have to do with #coronavirus? Nothing! It's a rally point conversation!
How the hell are Americans supposed to follow social distancing when our “leader” and this team are all shoulder to shoulder #coronavirus #COVID19 Please set an example for those who are not taking this serious
I thought this was a #coronavirus press conference? #CoronaTaskForce
Where’s the discussion of the Coronavirus?
Doctors can't use COVID-19 antibodies from gay men or anyone taking PrEP — Health officials say they have to turn away potential donors even if they have valuable coronavirus antibodies that could help save the seriously ill. https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/doctors-can-t-use-covid-19-antibodies-gay-men-or-n1174341 via @nbcnews

"IMHO, BIG changes coming concerning China and it's relationship with our economy. China lied about coronavirus, putting world in jeopardy, US intelligence agents say "
This is a superb graphic. And also makes apparent why many of us saw this coming looking at the data. It’s not too late to try and do everything we can to minimize the impact of the pandemic surge and the lives lost. #JustStayatHome #COVID19 #epidemiology @MIT #coronavirus 
This is a deflection White House briefing. @realDonaldTrump He is losing his standing amongst America because of his coronavirus response so here we are watching this disgusting waste of time while the American people die because of his inaction.
WTH does drug interdiction have to do with coronavirus????

The @WHO is the one that should be answering the questions about blood in their hands. They praised China’s handling of the #coronavirus in January. It’s disgusting. Their leader needs to be placed in prison with China’s leaders. They alone are responsible for this mess.

Interesting hospital info from Miami-Dade provided by @XavierLSuarez1 shows about 60 percent of the ventilator supply countywide is available for a future coronavirus surge. And extras available from Florida and from existing equipment. Key scorecard.
