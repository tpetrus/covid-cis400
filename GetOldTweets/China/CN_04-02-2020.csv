This shows that we have failed to make people aware about Corona virus. This also shows people's frustrations against police brutality and govt incapability to maintain law and order. There should have been other way to deal with the violators of rules instead of lathi charge.
If you have any symptoms suggestive of Coronavirus then please follow the guidelines and get tested. If positive you will need to be isolated in a hospital &amp; NOT at home. Antibiotics are for bacterial infections and not viral.
