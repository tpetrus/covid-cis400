"People are dying because of how you handled this crisis. Your too little, too late incapable way of handling this situation, even today, shows your failure as @POTUS #coronavirus"
President Trump fired a Captain of Army because of Soldiers was infectious with Coronavirus and tried to hide how many deaths be Coronavirus by Trump?
"They need to save their own people first, as does every country. Malaria is common in India, but coronavirus is everywhere. They’re trying to keep every other country from buying it all up from them."
"For years we’ve been saying that what 45s policies on the border constitute genocide. And now, with the spread of #coronavirus and lack of response, that is hard to deny... Tests are scarce at the border. The death toll is rising. "
"I agree with you %, but at the same time we have given it a break for three and a half years. The Coronavirus was the icing on the cake because we're talking about ""Humanity"" #HumanityBeforePolitics"
Tonic water contains quinine which is effective against malaria. Bacardi 151 kills bacteria. So it stands to reason that a combination of those two would beat coronavirus. Over the counter for the win! This is not medical advice. Do not do this.
